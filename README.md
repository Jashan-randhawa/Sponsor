🙌 Sponsor @Jashan-randhawa on GitHub Sponsors
👋 Hey, I'm Jashanpreet Singh — a full-stack developer with a passion for building efficient, scalable, and real-world web applications. I specialize in React, PHP, and MERN stack development, and I’m constantly refining my skills through algorithmic challenges and hands-on projects.

💡 Why Sponsor?
Your sponsorship helps me:

🛠️ Build and maintain open-source tools that solve real developer problems

📚 Share structured tutorials, README templates, and placement prep resources

🔍 Explore advanced topics like data mining, system design, and performance optimization

🎓 Mentor aspiring developers preparing for coding interviews and campus placements

Every contribution enables me to dedicate more time to the community—whether it's refining a Shopify clone, debugging edge cases in LeetCode problems, or documenting projects that help others learn faster and smarter.

🎯 My Goal
I'm aiming to reach 10 monthly sponsors to support ongoing work on portfolio projects, interview prep content, and open-source contributions. Your support helps me stay focused on what matters: building tools that are clean, practical, and impactful.

Thank you for believing in the mission. Let’s build something meaningful together. 💖
